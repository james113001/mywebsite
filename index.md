# About Me

I study biomedical engineering at the [University of Missouri-Columbia](https://missouri.edu/). My emphasis is in bioinformatics and pre-med, and coding for data analysis brings me pleasure, though this website was a fun challenge.

The past two summers, I conducted research in two labs: Georgia Institute of Technology/Emory University School of Medicine and University of Missouri. My interests lie in leveraging data analytics for public health. 

With the growing prominence of informatics, I will use population health research to focus on the health of the nationâ€™s low to middle income individuals, who suffer the most from healthcare access disparities. Furthermore, as an aspiring physician, I can also integrate my undergraduate education in bioinformatics with a future medical education to bridge the gap between the two fields. 

# Projects 
Clinician Burnout Project:  
We hypothesize that Electronic Medical Record (EMR) use metrics by physician correlate to physician burnout risk and remodeling the EMR workflow with be an interventional method to reduce burnout risk factors.

SemNet:  
The objective of this study is to identify and rank associative factors related to angiogenesis, fibrosis, and EF using an innovative literature mining approach, SemNet.
