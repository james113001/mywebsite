# Experience
I've been tutoring since 2015, between volunteering and paid positions. 
I have tutored people across K-12 and college, but most frequently working with high school or college students. My subjects of expertise are as follows:
- Math up to Calculus 2 including statistics
- Biology
- Physics
- Chemistry (inc. Organic)
- Biochemistry 1
- ACT/SAT/MCAT (all sections)
- Korean 

Some reviews:

- *"James is the best tutor I ever had!! He is very patient and is really good when it comes to helping you to understand the work."*

- *"James was very responsive to our needs from day one. I appreciated that James listened to what I thought were areas he needed to focus on with my son and on the day of the tutoring, he was very efficient and punctual and he conducted the session right away using Zoom meeting."*
